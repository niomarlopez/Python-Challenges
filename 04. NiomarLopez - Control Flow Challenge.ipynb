In the game, each number divisible by three will be returned with a Fizz and any number divisible by four will return a Buzz, if the number is divisble by 3 and 4 return FizzBuzz. This test has very little to do with data analysis, but it can help weed out weaker applicants so it is popular with interviewers."
